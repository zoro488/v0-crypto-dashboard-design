## Usage

To preview the project locally, first install the dependencies with your package manager of choice, using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

Then you can start the local dev server with

```
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

> [!NOTE]
> If you're deploying to a subdirectory (like `example.com/app/`), you might need to change the `wasmPath` prop in `page.tsx` accordingly.
